                    Initially, the reasons for undergoing the redesign were vague. Gritcube wanted the website to be more professional and concise. After three remote interviews, I found more specific pain points. The call-to-actions were unclear, and the content was difficult to skim.

                  In total, we reduced the copy by over 70%. Referencing the interviews, I deleted or moved sections to a different page. For example, I removed the paragraphs of the startups and consultants on the homepage because interviewees ignored them. Instead, interviewees visited the corresponding pages when they wanted information on consultants or startups. I also emphasized sections that proved helpful such as the ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù diagram.

                  I found there was a disconnect between Gritcube's ideal and existing brand identity. By examining non-profits Gritcube admired, such as Charity Water and Watsi, I decided to expand the color palette by experimenting with the opacity and saturation of the logo's colors. I also switched the typeface to Montserrat for its inherent contrast influenced by lettering in urban spaces.

                FreshPool is a traditional pool service company that wants to use technology to pivot to an on-demand business model. I worked closely with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjanecka/">Carey Janecka</a> and the founders to design mobile apps for pool owners and technicians.

                  After in-depth interviews with the founders and two pool technicians. I created user flows to explore the experience of the mobile apps. I trusted the founders' expertise to understand how people signed up for a pool service, and I talked with the pool technicians to learn about their workday.

                <p>
                  We initially assumed FreshPool should allow customers to select pool technicians, and we were unsure if signing up for a service should use step-by-step screens or a list view. I interviewed four potential customers, and I found they didn‚Äôt want to wait for technicians to accept their request. In a separate study, Carey learned people found it easier to follow step-by-step screens.

                  FreshPool wanted a minimal visual language, so we opted for a predominantly muted color palette and a single modern typeface. After creating the high-fidelity mockups, I used an InVision prototype and freehand to hand off the designs.

          <h2>
            Beyond digital design, I enjoy photography and traveling.
          </h2>
          <p>
          Both of these interests impacted my pursuit to be a designer. Photography encouraged me to learn visual composition and storytelling. I never thought I had a "good eye," but with practice, I got to the point where my friends at least trusted me to take their photo.
          </p>
          <p>
          Photography also taught me to observe the world around me. After countless gigabytes, I began to appreciate new details. Most importantly, I started to pay more attention to the interactions between people and our environments. In combination with traveling, I‚Äôve needed to confront my preconceived beliefs, leading to personal growth. I now seek out unknowns with the want to further practice empathy and test my assumptions.
