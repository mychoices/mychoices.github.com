              <p>Description:</p>
              <p>Gritcube is a non-profit that focuses on connecting African entrepreneurs with volunteer consultants. I worked closely with their Marketing Coordinator and President to redevelop their marketing website.</p>
              <p>Involvement:</p>

              <h3>How might we improve Gritcube‚Äôs online presence?</h3>
              <p>Initially, the reasons for undergoing the redesign were vague: Gritcube thought the website needed to be more professional and clear. After three remote interviews, we found the website already met those qualities, but the interviews revealed other pain points: the call-to-actions were unclear and the content was difficult to skim.</p>

              <h3>Unclear call-to-actions</h3>
              <p>Each page either lacked a call-to-action or the call-to-action didn‚Äôt stand out from the rest of the page‚Äôs content.</p>

                <h3>Lack of skimmability</h3>
                <p>Lengthy paragraphs and over-usage of centered text deterred interviewees from wanting to read sections such as the team‚Äôs background information.</p>

                <h3>Page layouts reorganized</h3>
                <p>Based on the interviews, I deleted unnecessary sections or moved them to different pages. In the case of the homepage, I removed the paragraphs of the startups and consultants. I found interviewees ignored the paragraphs, and instead, they visited the pages when they wanted information on either group. I also emphasized sections the interviewees found helpful such as the ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù diagram. In total, we reduced the content by 50%.</p>

                <p>I refreshed Gritcube‚Äôs branding by expanding the color pallete with additional colors from the logo and experimenting with opacity and saturation. I also switched the typeface to Montserrat for its inherent contrast influenced by lettering in urban spaces. After making final touches with custom illustrations, I coded the designs into a responsive site.</p>

          Beyond digital design, I enjoy photography and traveling.
        </h2>
        <p class="about-description">
        Both of these interests greatly impacted my pursuit to become a designer.  Photography gave me the encouragement to learn about visual composition and storytelling. I never considered myself a creative or artistic person, but with practice, I got to the point where my friends truted me to take the group photos.
        <br />
        <br />
        Photography also taught me to observe the world around me. After countless gigabytes, I began to appreciate new details, and most importantly, I started to pay more attention to other people and myself. In combination with traveling, I‚Äôve needed to confront my preconceived beliefs of people and our environments, leading to personal growth. I now seek out unknown unknowns with the want to further practice empathy and test my assumptions.

            After seven years in the bay area, I wanted more exposure to life outside of the tech bubble and in other regions of the U.S. Driving through 32 states and for 20,000+ miles, I met various people such as a retired photographer, natives of the Lakota tribe, and an aspiring fashion model.
