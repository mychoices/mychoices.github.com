After three remote interviews, we found the website already met those qualities, but the interviews revealed other pain points: the call-to-actions were unclear and the content was difficult to skim.</p>

                <p>Based on the interviews, I deleted unnecessary sections or moved them to different pages. In the case of the homepage, I removed the paragraphs of the startups and consultants. I found interviewees ignored the paragraphs, and instead, they visited the pages when they wanted information on either group. I also emphasized sections the interviewees found helpful such as the ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù diagram. In total, we reduced the content by 50%.</p>

I also switched the typeface to Montserrat for its inherent contrast influenced by lettering in urban spaces. After making final touches with custom illustrations, I coded the designs into a responsive site.</p>

                <p>We initially assumed FreshPool should allow customers to select pool technicians, and we were unsure if signing up for a service should use step-by-step screens or a list view. I interviewed four potential customers, and I found they didn‚Äôt want to have to wait for technicians to accept a service request. On a separate study, Carey learned the step-by-step flow was easier to follow.</p>

          <h2>
            Beyond digital design, I enjoy photography and traveling.
          </h2>
          <p>
          Both of these interests greatly impacted my pursuit to become a designer. Photography gave me the encouragement to learn visual composition and storytelling. I never thought I had a "good eye," but with practice, I got to the point where my friends at least trusted me to take their photo.
          </p>
          <p>
          Photography also taught me to observe the world around me. After countless gigabytes, I began to appreciate new details. Most importantly, I started to pay more attention to the interactions between people and our environments. In combination with traveling, I‚Äôve needed to confront my preconceived beliefs, leading to personal growth. I now seek out unknowns with the want to further practice empathy and test my assumptions.
